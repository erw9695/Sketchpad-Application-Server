# Sketchpad-Application-Server

This is the server-side code for the sketchpad application project (https://github.com/erw9695/Sketchpad-Application).  This handles the process of authenticating user log-ins and registering new users, sharing drawings with another user, requests to view any drawings shared with the user by another user, and downloading any drawings from another user.
